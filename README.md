BPM Seeded Save Generator is a project to dynamically generate ContinueStateV2.sav files for the game [BPM: Bullets Per Minute].

This project intends to create a small web-app that will allow users to specify their own seed as a string, upon which the app will generate the floor layouts, item pools, and floor modifier chances.
